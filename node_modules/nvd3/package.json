  "readme": "## NVD3 - A reusable D3 charting library\n\nInspired by the work of Mike Bostock's [Towards Reusable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/), and supported by a combined effort of [Novus](http://www.novus.com) and the NVD3 community.\n\n[View Examples](http://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/) | [NEW Documentation!](http://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/documentation.html) | Development build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/novus/nvd3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/novus/nvd3)\n\n\n## Usage\nSimply add the `nv.d3` assets to your project and include them in your HTML.\n\n```\n<link href=\"nv.d3.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<script src=\"nv.d3.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n*  `nv.d3.js` should appear after `d3.js` is included.\n* Prefer minified assets (`.min`) for production.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nNVD3 is recommended to go with [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) version 3.5.3 and later, but NOT d3 4.x yet.\n\n**Minimum D3 version required: 3.4.4**\n\nAlong with `pieChart` options `padAngle` and `cornerRadius`, the interactive guideline tooltip now requires these later versions of D3 (3.4.4+, specifically, to get interactive tooltips). The interactive guide lines rely on the more recent `d3.bisector()` method which treats accessors taking two parameters (the second being the element index) as comparators (see [d3.bisector()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Arrays#d3_bisector)).\n\n\n## Supported Browsers\nNVD3 runs best on WebKit based browsers.\n\n* Google Chrome: latest version\n* Opera 15+ (i.e. webkit version)\n* Safari: latest version\n* Firefox: latest version\n* Internet Explorer: 10+\n\n## Do we support D3 v4.x?\n\nNo, we do not...  we are very interested in taking this on but could use some help.  Please let us know if you'd like to help make this a reality!  :)\n\n## Changelog\n\n**1.8.5** Changes:\n\n* Community bugfixes\n* New force-directed graph\n\n**1.8.4** Changes:\n\n* Community bugfixes including tooltip fixes.\n\n**1.8.3** Changes:\n\n* Logs of community bugfixes\n* Added force-directed chart\n\n**1.8.2** Changes:\n\n* Lots of community bugfixes and a few extra minor features\n\n**1.8.1** Changes:\n\n* Tooltips were refactored - If you have customized your tooltips, note that you may need to adjust your custom functions as the data passed has changed format.  See the new [tooltip options](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/documentation.html#tooltip) for more details.\n* Added boxplot charts | [example](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/boxPlot.html)\n* Added candlestick charts | [example](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/candlestickChart.html)\n* Added extra donut chart abilities | [examples](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/monitoringChart.html)\n* Added sunburst Charts | [example](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/sunburst.html)\n* Time Series | [example](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/TimeSeries.html)\n* Another legend format available | [example](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/examples/stackedAreaChart.html)\n* Lots of bug fixes (see closed issues)\n* (for all examples, see [here](https://nvd3-community.github.io/nvd3/))\n\n**1.7.1** Changes:\n\n* Fixed axis.staggerLabels bug.\n* Fixed Karma unit tests.\n* Fixed chart test pages.\n* Merged in nvd3-community changes and development branch.\n\n**1.7.0** Changes:\n\n* Fixes around 20 small bugs.\n* Fixed the notorious slowness of line charts and scatter plots on chrome\n* Combined the scatterChart and scatterChartWithLines models\n* Combined the linePlusBarChart and linePlusBarChartWithFocus models.\n* renamed some of the options (see the new documentation for what options are available for each chart)\n* Completed the migration of the option functions to an object format which allows the generation of\nthe documentation in an automated way.  Not everything has a description yet, but check it out!\n* Added extra options to the donut charts based on features that will be in d3 3.5.  The donut example page\nloads the latest d3 from their 3.5 branch so keep that in mind.\n* Added an example of the parallelCoordinates chart.\n* Fixed up the half-done OHLC bar chart, and made an example for it as well.\n\n**1.6.0** Changes:\n\n* includes about a dozen bug fixes and pull requests I fixed and merged in\nfrom the issues/pulls from the original project.\n* It also standardized all indention\n\n---\n\n# Current development focus\n- Review outstanding pull requests and issues.\n- Try to find an easy way to actually document usage and all chart options.\n- Improve the testing framework.\n- Setup continuous integration.\n\n---\n\n# Bugs\n\nFound a bug?  Check out the latest from the `master` branch and make sure it's not already fixed first! If you don't see a related fix, please [open an issue](https://github.com/novus/nvd3/issues).\n\n---\n\n# Optional dependencies\n\nIncluding [Fastdom](https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom) in your project can greatly increase the performance of the line chart (particularly in Firefox and Internet Explorer) by batching DOM read and write operations to avoid [layout thrashing](http://wilsonpage.co.uk/preventing-layout-thrashing/). NVD3 will take advantage of Fastdom if present.\n\n---\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf one of [the existing models](https://github.com/novus/nvd3/tree/master/src/models)\ndoesn't meet your needs, fork the project, implement the model and an example using it,\nsend us a pull request, for consideration for inclusion in the project.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute consistently, show me what you've got with some good pull requests and you may get added to the nvd3-community org!\n\n### A few rules for pull requests\n\n1. Please commit to the `master` branch\n2. Do NOT check in anything under the `build` directory, it clutters up the commit and just gets overwritten later.\n3. All new features must come with unit test coverage\n4. Bug fixes should come with unit tests that prove their fix\n\nIf you want to test your changes using the example pages,\nyou'll have to run `grunt production` to build the items into the `build` directory.\nYou must do this before your changes show up in the examples, as they link to the build directory\nin order to properly show off the finished product.\nPlease remember to NOT include the build files in your commit though,\nonly include the source files you changed!\n\n### Tips for Testing\n* Unit tests were written in Karma and Mocha. Follow instructions in **Building Latest** to get npm packages setup. This may not work on Windows machines.\n* Run `bower install` to get bower dependencies.\n* Run `grunt` to start the unit tests.\n* Also visually inspect the HTML pages in the **examples/ and test/ folders**.  Make sure there are no glaring errors.\n* Novus now uses Travis CI for continuous integration. Visit [our travis build page](https://travis-ci.org/novus/nvd3/) to see the latest status.\n\n#### Meteor Tinytests\n* Any Meteor-specific features can be tested from the command line using `tinytest` and [Spacejam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spacejam)\n* `spacejam` can be installed by running `npm install -g spacejam`.\n* Tinytests can then be executed by running `spacejam test-packages ./` from this project's root.\n\n---\n\n## Building latest\n\n1. First clone the repository and checkout the `master` branch\n2. make sure `nodejs` is installed via your system's package manager.\n3. Install `grunt`, `grunt-cli`, and `bower`:  `npm install -g grunt grunt-cli bower`\n\n> have node download nvd3's required modules with:  `npm install`\n\n> build with:  `grunt production`\n\nYou should now have a `build` directory with the js and css files within.\n\n---\n",
