v.041
9/5/2016
-- Miz 0.041: updated to Meteor 1.4.1.1.

Noted issues:
    -  Seems operational.  Also - alignment now created in logs new entries.
    -  (Fixed) Your development database is using mmapv1, the old, pre-MongoDB 3.0 database engine. You should consider upgrading to Wired Tiger, the new engine. The easiest way to do so
       in development is to run meteor reset. If you'd like to migrate your database, please consult https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/release-notes/3.0-upgrade/
        - Installed b-crypt through NPM

    - Note: you are using a pure-JavaScript implementation of crypt.

v.039
8/30/2016

-- Updated to Meteor release 3.3.5.1

Noted Issues:
    - (fixed) System breaks with textAngular components present, most likely because of 'angular-sanitize'.  Displays blank
      screen on load
    - (fixed) Froala Text Details no longer display (notably log subentry details, which is displayed in HTML)
        -   ng-html-bind directive has stopped working, probably due to angular-sanitize missing
    - (open) Formatting for drop-box no longer works in log entry, but logo files now work.

Focus Fixes
    - Upgrade Froala to new version, then use Froala view for text captured by it
    - Uninstalled eastamis:angular-froala and assorted packages
        eastamis:angular-froala  removed from your project
        fortawesome:fontawesome  removed from your project
        froala:editor            removed from your project
        urigo:angular            removed from your project

    - fortawesome:fontawesome  added, version 4.4.0_1
      froala:editor            added, version 2.3.4

    - manually added angular-froala.js module
      Froala is working well - but needs to go through migration for settings/defaults ext.



v.038
-- Everything works in this version,  but not when deployed to the server.  However, a fully upgraded version works
   on the server, but with errors that are mirrored between development and deployment environments.  Instead of
   troubleshooting production environment, will troubleshoot app to get it up to speed.

-- cfs:gridfs  upgraded from 0.0.33 to 0.0.34

   This package is from: https://github.com/badmark/Meteor-CollectionFS.
   It fixes a dependency caused by upgrading node that would result in error messages with:
   [Error: Cannot find module '../build/Release/bson'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
   (STDERR) js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version

   This forked version has been updated to work with Meteor 1.4.

   Note that CollectionFS has been deprecated and those packages (and the database!) will need to be
   eventually migrated out.
