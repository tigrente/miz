DEPLOYING MIZ TO AN UBUNTU SERVER

Deploying miz to a Futurewei ubuntu server comes with the significant increased challenge of making it work behind
a very strict proxy.   Typically, we would use MUPX (MeteorUp X) to deploy the app to the server and mangage the
environment, but this has not been possible because Meteor can not download any modules through the proxy, regardless
of proxy settings.  (Seems to be an SSL issue, but after much troubleshooting, I have been unable to resolve this.)

Instead, we manually deploy Miz to the server.

UPDATING MIZ
(1) Build a tar in the development environment.  This will build a tarball a directory above the meteor home directory
    >>  meteor build --architecture os.linux.x86_64 ..

(2) FTP is to the server, and place it in the /home/miz directory.

(3) Stop the application
    >> stop miz

(3) Remove the existing build
    >> cd /home/miz
    >> rm -rf build

(4) Untar it and create the new build directory
    >> tar -zxvf miz.tar.gz

(5) <<MAYBE>>  Fix the lock issue

(6) Go to the server directory in the build
    >> cd /home/miz/bundle/program/server

(7) Build the app
    >> npm install
    // did it not work?  Fix your proxy settings
        >> npm config edit
        >> 
proxy=http://a00754691:S00perman@proxyus3.huawei.com:8080/
strict-ssl=false
 (remove the proxy-https)


 (8) To start the service, run the command
 >> start miz

 

RESTORING MIZ DATABASE
mongorestore --db miz —-drop /home/etc/drop/meteor
— miz is the name of the production database
- assumes backup in /home/etc/drop/meteor


REGARDING THE CLIENT ENVIRONMENT
Huawei has installed a web securtiy application called WebSense, which scans every upload and significantly slows down
Miz.  To mitgate, use Chrome in "Incognito Mode". Websense is not loaded in this mode, and uploads are fast and snappy,
like in the test environment.

 
LOG

1/20.2016
-- Removed SSL binding for NGINX.  Now, Miz functions without SSL protecciton, eliminating warnings.

9/12/2016
-- Updated to Ubuntu 16.04.1
-- Upstart is replaced in upgrade, reinstalled
-- Uploads no longer work in Chrome, but work in IE.  Seems to be blocked by websense?
